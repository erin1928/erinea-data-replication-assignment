## Introduction

My study is testing the theory that bees prefer to frequent the same flowers, as opposed to visiting multiple different flowers in a patch. Sampling was done in Sweden with reared colonies of bees in an open field. Bees were individually marked and tagged and left to pollinate for 5 days at a time. After each period pollen was removed from the bees bodies and collected in jars. Machine learning was used to identify pollen samples from specific flowers which were identified in the field. After the program was run, individual pollen samples from tagged bees were added to a csv file, noting each bee and where their pollen came from, as well as how much (in g) of pollen they had extracted from each flower species per trip. 

For this assignment I am going to replicate a bar graph demonstrating the average amount (in grams) of pollen for each flower type collected across all collection days. Then, I am going to run a Jaccard similarity test to compare colony and pollen sample, to reject the idea that colony impacts pollen type, an idea which allows the researchers to expand their results to conclude dustance from oilseed rape is most impactful on flower pollen type. In the paper "flower constancy" is a variable that is repeatedly used and very tricky to calculate, ultamately I was unable to replicate this necessary statistic. Instead, I wanted to continue to work to replicate the type of regressions being run so I independelty run a GLM of flower species and date collection to try my best to mirror their GLM of time between collections and flower constancy.

Finally, I will replicate a descriptive statistic describing the percentage of the most widely collected pollen type and confirm researcher's punlished statistics.

## Figure Replication 


First, let's call our data!
```{r csv, include=TRUE}
bee_data <- read.csv("bee_data.csv", sep = ',', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(bee_data)
```
Now, we must identify and name all of the relevant columns within the csv. Here I am calling the columns of flower species that pollen was taken from, and giving them an easier and more memorable name to work with throughout the replication assignment.
```{r calling rows, include = TRUE}
Prunus <- (bee_data$P_Prunus.group)
Brassicaceae <- (bee_data$P_Brassicaceae)
Lamium <- (bee_data$P_Lamium)
Acer <- (bee_data$P_Acer)
Lonicera <- (bee_data$P_Lonicera)
Salix <- (bee_data$P_Salix)
Prunus_Group_B <- sample(bee_data$P_Prunus.groupB)
Papaver <- (bee_data$P_Papaver)
Cytisus <- (bee_data$P_Cytisus)
Trifolium_repens <- (bee_data$P_Trifolium.repens.group)
Aesculus <- (bee_data$P_Aesculus)
Pulmonaria_Group <- (bee_data$P_Pulmonaria.group)
Laburnum <- (bee_data$P_Laburnum)
Phacelia <- (bee_data$P_Phacelia)
```

In order to replicate our first figure, the mean weight (in grams) of each pollen type needs to be calculated. By using the mean() function I am directly calculating the averages of each column that I assigned in the previous step.
```{r calculating means, include=TRUE}
mean(Prunus)
mean(Brassicaceae)
mean(Lamium)
mean(Acer)
mean(Lonicera)
mean(Salix)
mean(Prunus_Group_B)
mean(Papaver)
mean(Cytisus)
mean(Trifolium_repens)
mean(Aesculus)
mean(Pulmonaria_Group)
mean(Laburnum)
mean(Phacelia)
```
It's time to start plotting our figure! First, I am setting a character vector "means" that is comprised of all of the means calculated in the first step. This will allow me to call my "means" easily and quickly when I code my bar chart. Next, I'm setting a character vector of flower species "Flower_species" for the same reason. This will allow me to call all of the species on the x-axis using the names.arg() argument later on. Finally, I am importing a package to allow me to assign colors to my bars to distinguish species visually.
```{r bar chart, include=TRUE}
#setting a common numerical value to pull from in the y axis
means <- c(mean(Prunus), mean(Brassicaceae), mean(Lamium), mean(Acer), mean(Lonicera), mean(Salix), mean(Prunus_Group_B), mean(Papaver), mean(Cytisus), mean(Trifolium_repens), mean(Aesculus), mean(Pulmonaria_Group), mean(Laburnum), mean(Phacelia))
#Now using a character vector to pull names of each group on the x-axis
Flower_species <- c("Prunus", "Brassicaceae", "Lamium", "Acer", "Lonicera", "Salix", "Prunus_Group_B", "Papaver", "Cytisus", "Trifolium_repens", "Aesculus", "Pulmonaria_Group", "Laburnum", "Phacelia")
library(RColorBrewer)
coul <- brewer.pal(14, "Set3")
#This sets rainbow colors for my graph
par(mar=c(8,4,4,1)+.1)
#This changes the margins on my graph, the first one deals with the bottom allowing me to fit all the words onto the chart
barplot(means, ylim = c(0.00, 0.20), names.arg = Flower_species, las = 2, space = 0.05, xlab = " ", ylab = "Pollen Proportion", main = "Pollen Proportion vs. Flower Species", col=coul, cex.axis=0.9)
# las = 2 moves the x-axis labels vertical
```
To compare, let's pull the original chart made by the authors. Looks pretty good!

## Jaccard Test


In the paper, the researchers ran a Jaccard similarity test on a scale of 0 to 1. Jaccard similarity of 0 means the variables had no overlap, and 1 means the variables had extreme overlap. I ran one of the similarity tests between pollen sample and colony ID and got that there was no overlap between the colony the bees were a part of and the pollen they sampled, meaning that these two variables do not affect each other, and instead, allow us to conclude that something else (other than the colony bees come from) is what's causing this constancy. And indeed, the authors proposed that colony DISTANCE is what is primarily affecting the return to the same flowers.
```{r Jaccard pollen similarity, include=TRUE}
colony <- (bee_data$coln)
pollen.sample <- (bee_data$filn)
jaccard <- function(colony, pollen.sample) {
    intersection = length(intersect(colony, pollen.sample))
    union = length(colony) + length(pollen.sample) - intersection
    return (intersection/union)
}
jaccard(colony,pollen.sample)
```

## Additional Inferential Analysis

In the paper, researchers compare the distance from oil seed rape fields to flower constancy using a GLMM. However, all non-descriptive statistics required the running of a complex Jaccard similarity test using named Jaccard distances via an inverted Jaccard similarity test. I was unable to replicate this statistic because of the in-depth nature of naming these distances, as well as running a statistic we have not covered and I was unable to effectively teach myself. Since I was unable to come up with the "flower constancy" values I was unable to run any of the inferential analyses done in this paper. Instead, I ran and interpreted an independent analysis with the available data. 

I decided to run a GLMM (used in the paper) to compare the date of sample collection to the amount of Prunus Group B flower pollen in the sample per date. First, I made sure the two variables I was working with were of the same length (a problem I was having when trying to replicate the original GLM) using the length function.

Then, I set up my glm running the date collected to the species of interest.
```{r date, include=TRUE}
date <-bee_data$dat
length(date) #looking at the lengths of dates
length(Prunus_Group_B)#looking at the lengths of the desired flower species
glm <- glm(data = bee_data, date ~ Prunus_Group_B, family = "binomial") #create the glm
summary(glm) #call the results
```


The GLM that I ran was also not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.293 and shows no correlation between sample date and Prunus flower species.


## Descriptive Statistic 


The authors stated that the pollen from the Prunus group of flowers was the most pollinated overall, with the total percentage of pollen samples from these flowers equaling 20%. To test this I first named all the means of each flower species to be able to use them in a later calculation. Then, I added all of these called means together to get the whole number of pollen samples from each species together. Finally, I divided that total means number just calculated by the mean of the Prunus group flowers and multiplied by 100%. 
```{r percentage Prunus Group, include=TRUE}
mean_Prunus <- mean(Prunus) #naming the numerical outputs for later calculation
mean_Brassicaceae <- mean(Brassicaceae)
mean_Lamium <- mean(Lamium)
mean_Acer <- mean(Acer)
mean_Lonicera <- mean(Lonicera)
mean_Salix <- mean(Salix)
mean_Prunus_Group_B <- mean(Prunus_Group_B)
mean_Papaver <- mean(Papaver)
mean_Cytisus <- mean(Cytisus)
mean_Trifolium_repens <- mean(Trifolium_repens)
mean_Aesculus <- mean(Aesculus)
mean_Pulmonaria_Group <- mean(Pulmonaria_Group)
mean_Laburnum <- mean(Laburnum)
mean_Phacelia <- mean(Phacelia)

total_means <- (mean_Prunus + mean_Brassicaceae + mean_Lamium + mean_Acer + mean_Lonicera + mean_Salix + mean_Prunus_Group_B + mean_Papaver + mean_Cytisus + mean_Trifolium_repens + mean_Aesculus + mean_Pulmonaria_Group + mean_Laburnum + mean_Phacelia) #Adding up all the numerical outputs to allow for an easy calculation in the next step
total_means
percent_prunus_group <- (mean_Prunus/total_means)*100 #Calculating the percentage of our desired species by dividing by the whole and multiplying by 100
percent_prunus_group
```
My final output was 22.07%, rounding down to 20%, the same as what our author's stated! (It would be nice to see a little bit more accuracy from them though!)
